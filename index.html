      <p1>Coding is my favourite hobby . I find coding very interesting , fascinating and creative . The most fascinating thing about coding is that we can create any type of application ,website , webpage etc by coding .Coding is the future of our world as technology can be created only by coding . Learning coding is very important . A coder can completly change the world and these days 90% of the companies require an appliction to perform their key activities .

Learning coding is not important only because it is our future it also helps you to grow mentaly and also makes you creative . </p1>
